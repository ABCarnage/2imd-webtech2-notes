## Social coding with Git
### What is git
Git is a version control system or VCS. Another famous version control system is SVN or Subversion. A version control system makes it easier to collaborate on projects in teams, especially when a project consists of source code like PHP, HTML, .. 

Git is a distributed VCS while Subversion is a centralized VCS. When using a distributed VCS like Git, you commit your changes locally on your machine until your are ready to push your changes to an online repository. In a centralized VCS like Subversion, commits are done on a central server.

A possible issue with systems like SVN is that when the online repository/server goes down, you can't commit your work until the server comes back online. With Git, that problem goes away as all commits are done locally first. Git also allows us to use multiple repositories and synchronize work between them if we wanted to. This creates greater freedom when it comes to setting up development workflows.

Without a good VCS it would be a lot harder to collaborate on projects and safely deploy them to staging and production servers. More on deployment later.

### git core concepts

#### clone

#### pull/push

#### commit
A commit should be a container for small and related changes. Fixing two bugs for example should produce two separate commits.

#### fetch

#### branch

#### merge

#### rebase

#### production-ready master approach

### github.com

#### pull requests

### What is markdown
You may have noticed that this course is published on github in a file called README.md. Pay attention to the extension .md which stands for markdown.
