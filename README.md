## Social coding with Git
### What is git
Git is a version control system or VCS. Another famous version control system is SVN or Subversion. A version control system makes it easier to collaborate on projects in teams, especially when a project consists of source code like PHP, HTML, .. 

Git is a distributed VCS while Subversion is a centralized VCS. When using a distributed VCS like Git, you commit your changes locally on your machine until your are ready to push your changes to an online repository. In a centralized VCS like Subversion, commits are done on a central server.

The clear problem with systems like SVN is that when the online repository/server goes down, you can't commit your work until the server comes back online. With Git, that problem goes away as all commits are done locally first. Git also allows us to use multiple repositories and synchronize work between them if we wanted to. This created greater freedom when it comes to setting up development workflows.
